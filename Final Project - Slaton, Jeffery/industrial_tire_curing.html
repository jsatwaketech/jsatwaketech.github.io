<p>Did you know rubber is not naturally black? It is dyed using material called carbon black, which is essentially just finely ground coal. This is what dyes the rubber and makes it black.<br><br>

There are many different layers of a tire. Starting with a butyl rubber layer, many different strips of various rubber or metal are laid on top of one another in very specific portions, and eventually form a “green tire” (green as in uncured, not the color), which looks almost like a black donut.<br><br>

These black donuts are loaded into tire presses or what you could imagine in your head as an enormous waffle iron. This mold has all of the markings and tread features of the tire and creates what you imagine when you picture a tire. These presses run at over 300 °F and use an inflatable bladder to push the green tire deep into the grooves of the mold!</p>
