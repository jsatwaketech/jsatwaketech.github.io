The API in Tylenol is called acetaminophen, but there’s many other materials inside the pill itself, such as binding agents, caking agents, and others to help the pill hold its shape. Nearly all APIs are just white powders. When the pills are made, the API is weighed out to specific proportions, such as 500 mg for acetaminophen, and then pressed with the other ingredients to form the pill you would take for a headache.<br>
  <br>

This industry is enormously regulated and it’s for a good reason: the materials used to make these APIs are generally very nasty stuff, such as carcinogenic or teratogenic. Ironically, the very cancers you can get from making certain drugs can be cured by taking the final drug itself!<br><br>

All APIs start from raw materials, such as powders, that you mix in varying proportions dissolved in solvents that then go through many unit operations, such as distillation, solvent swaps, centrifugation, crystallization, and drying, to then form the API! </p>
