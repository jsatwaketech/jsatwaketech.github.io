<p>This was my first foray into the magnificent industry of manufacturing and I learned a lot.<br><br>
    
  First off, I learned that many external pieces of modern cars are actually plastic. Well, technically a proprietary blend of polymers generally made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS. The front & rear bumper, the wheel well, undercarriage accents, and fender pieces are all made of this plastic material. Only the hood, doors, roof, and frame of the door are made of steel!<br><br>
    
    
  These ABS beads are melted and then molded in multi-ton molds to form the pieces you picture in your mind! Initially, they are all a matte black and must be painted.<br><br>
    
  In the painting process, multiple, huge robotic arms containing sprayers on the end rotate around these bumpers and follow a very specific path to ensure a perfectly even coat on every square inch of surface of the piece! There are 3 primary coats of a paint job:<br>

  
<p>1. The base coat (generally a grey material)</p>
    <p>2. The primary coat (this is what gives it its color)</p>
    <p>3. The clear coat (this protects the integrity of the paint)</p>

<p>
Sometimes, there is even a four coat of paint, called the mica layer, that is sprayed on top of the primary coat. If you ever notice a paint job that is particularly sparkly, it actually has tiny bits of shaved, thin aluminum specs in there to assist its shine!</p>
